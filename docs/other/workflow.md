# Knowledge & project management

I've always been a bit of a nerd when it comes to organization. I feel lost without it and I tend to brach out so much that without an adequate structure, I wouldn't even know what projects I'm involved in and what I need to do.
At the same time, the scientific research process requires keeping up-to-date with the literature and knowledge. Given, again, my propensity to branch out, over the years, I have acquired quite the bibliography and have taken extensive notes and written down ideas in various formats. 

To aggregate all this information coherently and productively, I have (after many failed attempts) found the ideal workflow (ideal(ish), as this is still not perfect):

- Daily / weekly task management - Sunsama


- Incoming links, videos and interesting stuff to parse: Obsidian (Desktop vault, daily note)

- Incoming papers: Zotero folder (to_parse)

On a weekly basis, incoming information is parsed and organized in Zotero (papers to read and annotations) and in Obsidian (useful links, notes and things to read/watch). After a lot of trial-and-error, I also use Raindrop.io to store and organize web clips and links

- Project planning and management: Obsidian (research vault) + TodoIst 
	- The integration with ToDoist allows me to port tasks directly to Sunsama

- Knowledge management: Obsidian (research vault) + Zotero (collections)
