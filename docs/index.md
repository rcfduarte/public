Welcome to my (public) second brain. I am a computational neuroscientist, interested in unravelling the mysteries of Mind&Brain. My approach is largely focused on the implementational level. Here, I will share ideas, interesting literature, notebooks and reviews on topics I find interesting and the progress of some ongoing research projects. In addition, I may from time to time post content on my workflow and some other blabbings.

The objective of hosting a public *second brain* or an *idea garden* is two-fold: on the one hand, it helps me organize my thoughts and keep the big picture in focus (I have a tendency to branch out, frequently leading to combinatorial explosion); the second objective is to foster knowledge exchanges and collaborations.

All the content posted here is my own responsibility and does not reflect the positions of the institutions I'm affiliated with.


My research follows 4 complementary and highly intertwinned **Research Themes**:

1. The biophysical bases (bottom-up)
	- Neuronal mechanics: intrinsic adaptation, dendritic computation and compartmentalized learning
	- Synaptic mechanics: Hebbian learning and neuromodulation 

2. The microcircuit level 
	- Modularity and metastability
	- Columnar organization of the cerebral cortex

3. The mesoscopic level
	- Hierarchical temporal specializations
	- Cortico-striatal interactions and bio-inspired RL

4. Cognition & Behavior
	- Functional and dysfunctional states
	- Sequence learning
